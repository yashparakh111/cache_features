- Traces contains traces file for various programs.
	- Format:	<\ignore> <PC> <data address> <ignore> <hit/miss with OPT> <accurate/inaccurate with Hawkeye>
	- More concretely, each line in the trace is a cache access, and the fields represent the following:
		- Bool to indicate whether feedback has been received. You can ignore this field.
		- The memory address of the cache access
		- The load instruction address (PC) of the cache access
		- The probability of a cache hit as measured by my simple PC-based predictor (a value of 2 indicates that the predictor has not been trained).
		- The OPT decision to cache or not cache
		- This bit indicates whether Hawkeye's simple predictor got it right or wrong.

- Analysis_* contains python code to analyze these programs.
